Hours in a year:

puts 24 * 365

Minutes in a decade:

puts 60 * 24 * 365 * 10

What does puts do?

* 'puts' stands for 'put string' which is a simple command to print what is placed in the input onto the console. However unlike 'print', 'puts' includes a blank line after what is printed.

What is an integer? What is a float?

* an integer is a complete or whole number while a float is a number with a decimal point.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

* when dividing integers ruby will always round the result down to the nearest full number.  An example would be 9/2 == 4.  This would make sense in that if you had $9 and a chocolate bar is $2, how many chocolate bars could you buy for yourself?  The answer would be 4 chocolate bars, seeing that no chocolate vendor would likely sell you half of a snickers bar!
