       Hi guys!  Happy Monday!  Now that we've learned much about the basics of Ruby... What the hell is Rails!?

    </p> The first thing I noticed when actually Googleing 'Rails' for the first time is that within the first paragraph of a page describing what rails is and what rails does mentioned that many experienced develops report that using rails to make web application development actually made development fun!  And who doesn't like fun?  That was enough to bait me to read further...
    <p>
        
    </p> Rails is actually a web application development framework written in the Ruby programming language.  The framework itself is intended to encourage efficiency with developers - it functions under the assumption that there is a preferable way to do things and when a developer familiarizes himself with "The Rails Way" he or she will experience a greater command of efficiency of Ruby's implementation, and likely marked increace in productivity.
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
       There are 2 essential pillars of the Rails structure:
    </p>
     <p>
      DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF: the famous DRY principle which demands that every character in a set of code must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative function within a program.  While repetitious and clunky code may work well - it is prone to be buggier and less easy to maintain.
    </p>
    <p>
      CONVENTION OVER CONFIGURATION: Rails has opinions about the best way to do things in the web application environment, and an effective Rails developer will be familiar and comfortable with these conventions to put them to use to his advantage.
    </p> 

     <p>
      Happy Monday All!  Can't wait to see all of your faces in exactly 1 week!
