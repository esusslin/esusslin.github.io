       Hi guys!  Happy Monday!  Welcome to the wonderful world of ennumerables!

    </p>
    <p>
        I've spent some time this week with .map and I'd like to review what i've learned and how i've implemented it this week.

        I think of .map as almost "covering the whole map" the way for instance a group of kids might want to stop by EVERY house in their neighborhood during halloween so as to maximize their trick-or-treat candy and to not miss any house (or object) in the neighborhood.  In this way .map is similar to .each in that it addresses every value within an array.
    </p>
    <p>
       I used .map earlier this week to assess whether any given element in an array was a number, or an integer, to which I could apply some simple addition.  Before I could go about adding anything to the various integers scattered throughout the array I had to identify which elements in the array were indeed integers as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
       def my_array_modification_method!(source, thing_to_modify)
          source.map {|i| i.is_a?(Integer) ? (i + thing_to_modify) : i} 
        end
    </p>

    <p>
        You can see here that .map allowed me to basically go to each element and ask if the element was an integer - just as a band of trick-or-treaters would go to each house and ask whether or not the home-dwellers would prefer to be tricked or offer up a treat (this example is waning in quality - my apologies... BOO!).
    </p>

     <p>
        Just like many other non-boolean methods, the .map can be made destructive so as to permanently alter the contents of the array by adding the famous ! at the end of it as I've done below:
    </p>

      <p>
       def my_array_modification_method!(source, thing_to_modify)
          source.map! {|i| i.is_a?(Integer) ? (i + thing_to_modify) : i} 
        end
    </p>

    <p> ^^^^ This would almost compare to a band of trick or treaters growing too old for dressing up for candy (for me it was 7th-8th grade) and deciding instead that they'd prefer to go out on CABBAGE NIGHT - as we called it in Vermont - during which young misfit youth would typically pull vegetables from farmers' gardens and throw them at the barn door (especially cabbage) - causing mayhem and one-way destruction of carved pumpkins, eggs (thrown onto houses) and any other form of destructive food-related mayhem.....   and with that my metaphoric analogy is no longer helpful or accurate - but you get the point.  Happy Monday !!
