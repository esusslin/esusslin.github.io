      What are the benefits of version control?

      Well first of all, version control is amazing.  With version control you can efficiently keep tabs on all of the stages of progress and project makes as it develops.  Whether it is a small group of developers or an open source project with an unlimited about of contributers version control provides the platform in which development work can be contributed by one individual and confirmed for implementation by another in a communally progressive way.  Not only that, with each improvement - or 'version' a snapshot is taken of the project at that state, so in the event of bugs and any other problems or revisional demands, any given previous 'snapshot' or 'commit' can be restored at any of these stages in the need to "go back a few steps."

        How does git help you keep track of changes?

        It tells you who made changes, or commits, when and why.  The commit log stores all of this information.

       Why use GitHub to store your code?

       So you can develop your code with a group of interactive developers and restore every stage of its development for retro-active work or just as a case-study of how the project evolved over time into its current or final state.
