Objects are everywhere and many remain singularly existent:  my watch is an object, my brother's car is an object, I myself am an object.  I consider all 3 'things' to be objects fairly independent of each other or any other object - my watch has been on my wrist since my birthday in 2013, my brother's car has been his since its purchase last summer, and finally I have been my own object since the day of my birth!  I am me, no one else is me; and to my knowledge my extraordinary good looks, sharp wit and remarkable presence in all social scenarios are largely unmatched by anyone on planet earth.

</p>

<p>
However this is not to say that objects cannot be considered in the contexts of their groupings with other objects - and this is how, theoretically, arrays and hashes work in the coding world to store objects and information on the web.  Despite my undeniable, blinding value as an individual I have countlessly, and currently am, a part of many groups.  I work at a law firm in New York called Desmarais LLP, i could easily be grouped into a figurative/theoretical container with the rest of my coworkers - we all work at Desmarais LLP.  In much the same way an array is a container of objects - just like a directory of Desmarais LLP would list a set of names of the individuals who work here.
</p>

<p>
An array works like this, as a container, or 'set' of objects.  Within this set of objects, people (objects) could be newly hired to work here (added), fired (subtracted) perhaps bought out by another, larger lawfirm - (added to another array (that will never happen, Desmarais LLP will forever be its own!)).  An array is a group of objects just like my office is a group of people:
</p>

<p>
[Emmet, John, Paul, Jonas, Alan, Sean, Matt]
</p>

<p>
But what if someone wanted to call myself or one of my co-workers directly?  Surely a container with merely a list of our names would hardly suffice to help to this end.  A telephone directly would be much more helpful - a listing of employees with a single, direct phone line listed next to each name.  VIOLA! Accessing each empoyee via phone is remarkably easy, each has a KEY (phone code) by which they can be accessed. In the same way a hash is very much like an array, but for each object a KEY value is assessed to access/retrieve the object quickly:
</p>

<p>
phone= { "5448" => "Emmet",
            "4892" => "Paul",
            "2394 => "Jonas",
            "6893" => "Alan" 
            "8904" => "Sean" 
            "6090" => "Matt"                       
          }
</p>

<p>
Both serve as containers of objects at any given time.  The objects can be shifted, retrieved, added and taken out in arrays, and beyond that, can be accessed by their unique key value in hashes.
</p>

<p>
Happy New Year, may your 2016 be like no other!
