<h1>Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript Objects</h1>

</header>

<p>
It's been interesting wading into javascript after spending 3 weeks developing my ruby skills.  In many ways it certainly feels like looking backward through time as it seems - and I could be wrong here - that ruby borrowed many conventions from javascript and evolved in a new direction in many ways as a coding language in and of itself.  Some of you folks might dislike this albiet questionable analogy - but an introduction of javascript through the lense of ruby is almost like looking back an a language from which your current language evolved - like someone well-spoken in Canadian French (from Quebec) visiting France and seeing a form of their own langage before it elovlved into Canadian French (which from what I understand is very eloved and in many ways incongruent with Parisian French).</p>

<p> One point at which Ruby seemed to take a bit of its own direction was its introduction of <span class="bold">hash values</span> as being very similar to objects in javascript.  They do roughly the same thing - they both represent a collection of properties and values.  The values for both structures can be accessed by employing the corresponding key / property. They even LOOK alike with very similar syntax.  While both seem incredibly similar, a few </p>

<p>There are however a few differences, a major one being that Javascript objects can take a function as a value.  Functions, much like methods in ruby, are themselves objects, while in Ruby methods are strictly a means of <span class="bold">manipulating</span> objects.  So what this allows is for javascript objects to possess, in a sense, functionality, while hashes in Ruby are strictly data structures for story data.  While Ruby hashes don't permit this storage of functionality, ruby classes do provide as much - classes can be used to inherit build-in methods from other classes and variable structures that can are both entirely capable within the object construct in Javascript. </p>  

<p>This may seem wordy and confusing because the differences literally are wordy and confusing!  An example that would explain the difference would be storing a person's information.  In js 'Dave' could consitute an object with several property/value pairs - his height, weight, age, etc.  To initiate an object that would constitute a friend of his "Mark" a new object with the same property/value pairing could be build using a constructor.  If 'Dave' were a ruby hash, it would not be possible to create "Mark" - in fact a 'class' initiated would need to be established and 'Dave' would be added as another instance of this class.  Let's call this class 'Peope'</p>


<p> Happy Monday January 25th Y'all - see you in a few! </p>
