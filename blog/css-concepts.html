<h1> ~ Tap That ~ </h1>

<p>
CSS demands to be told what to do.  Commands must be directed to <span class="bold">subjects</span> within the HTML file so the CSS code knows exactly <span class="bold">which</span> HTML code to manipulate.  With Classes and IDs we can do just <span class="bold">that!</span></p>

<p> Think of CSS as a series of tools (many tools).  For our purposes lets imagine a tool - say an axe.  If you have an able bodied lumberjack at your disposal at the edge of a forest, and you put an axe in his hand and tell him to start chopping shit, the results will be undesireable unless you are aiming for anarchical tree destruction. </p>

<p> Lets say for example you are interested in chopping down only the cherry trees in the forest to cut up and refine into cutting boards for christmas gifts - you would need to identify each of the cherry trees to this able-bodied lumberjack so he knows which trees to apply the axe and take down.  As such this lumberjack under your employ must be directed to this class of trees - in this case all of the cherry trees. A class is a series of elements that need to be 'treated' the same was by the CSS code the way a lumberjack would need to treat a series of cherry trees.</p>  

<p>In the paragraph above I commanded my CSS file to make 3 different words bold by identifying all 3 words in the underlying HTML file the the class: "bold" - see below:</p>

</p>

<p> Now what if I wanted to tell this lumberjack to cut down a single <span id="tap">maple tree</span> to tap for maple syrup?  To this point he only knows how to swing an axe at a marked cherry tree - or a class of 'to be chopped cherry trees' - but what if I want him to tap a single maple tree for sap rather than cut it down?  To this end, I would identify a <span class="bold">single</span></p> maple tree for the lumberjack to tap for sap to be boiled into maple syrup. </p>

<p>In the paragraph directly above this one, I commanded my CSS file to make the first iteration of "maple syrup" red and bold by identifying this single term in the underlying HTML file as: "tap" - see below:</p>

<p>
<img src="../imgs/screen_shot_id.png"/>
</p>

<p><span class="bold">AS SUCH</span>, in much the same way a simple lumberjack would need individual jobs, like tapping a single maple tree, or broad jobs, like cutting down every cherry tree - CSS needs to be directed to act on single instances or classes of multiple elements with specificity, lest all trees get chopped and tapped in anarchical fashion.</p>

<p> Happy Holidays Y'all - see you in a few! </p>
