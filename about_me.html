        I was born in St. Albans, Vermont - a small town about 10 miles from the Canadian border.  I am at least a 5th generation Vermonter on both sides of my family.  I grew up playing the drums and playing hockey - those were my two impulsive interests as far back as i can remember.  I played hockey until I was 18.  I still play the drums all the time.

       In High School I hated chemistry but I liked math and physics and did fairly well with calculus.  My jam was english lit / history and the like - I feel like I found my voice in HS english class for communicating - reading and discussing stuff like Shakespeare really sort of got me off so I pursued that direction in college - I was an English Literature major at Skidmore College in upstate New York.

       I came out of undergrad with very little idea of what I wanted to do professionally.  I travelled a bunch after college and then settled in NYC where I began working as a paralegal at a law firm and played in several bands in NYC - which was a blast (the drumming).  I was 24 years old and figured I'd make a good lawyer so I started working for lawyers.  I was always interested in politics and and always felt I had strong communication skills so - heck why not?  As it turned out I worked for many amazing lawyers but the work never appealed to me at all once I was what it looked like in person.  I worked at one firm, left it for another firm for more $$ and then branched into the legal tech industry where I've been for the last few years.  It turns out the legal world wasn't really for me and I am excited to leave it to pursue web development full time.

      Beyond my interests in hockey and drumming I am a pretty big audio fiend - ask me for music recommendations if you ever need something new and send something my way if you are an enthusiast yourself.  I listen to a lot of disco/house like the rest of the world these days but I listen to a lot of jazz, hip-hop, rock => you name it.

        Something weird... My Great-Great-Great-Great-Great-Great Grandmother's name was Sarah Towne Cloyce and she was accused of being a witch in Salem, Massachussetts in 1692.  Her 2 sisters were actually executed for being witches.  Seriously, ask me about it.

        That's my story!  Super excited to be at DBC with all of you - really can't wait to get started at the San Francisco campus in a few weeks. ~ Namaste ~
